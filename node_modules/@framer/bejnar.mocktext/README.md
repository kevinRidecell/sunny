# MockText: A Lorem Ipsum placeholder textbox component

This is a very simple component to create boxes of placeholder 'lorem ipsum' text.

## Features

- Control the text length
- Choose from a few basic fonts
- Choose a custom font on your system using its CSS selector
- Change font color
- Adjust font size
- Adjust line spacing
- Align text to left, right or center
- Adjust font weight between 100 and 900

## Adding custom fonts

Until Framer X allows us to use their native font selector, you can choose from a selection of fonts in the dropdown. Or, if you have another font you would like to use that is already installed on your system, simply type in the name in the Custom Font field, just as you would in CSS.
