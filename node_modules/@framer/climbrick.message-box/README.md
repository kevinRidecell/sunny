# Message Box

If you need to display alerts, dialogs, toasts and other types of messages in your UI, then you need Message Box! Message box is a simple, yet powerful component allowing you to control...

## Title and Message
Control every aspect of your message by adjusting the text, font family, font weight, size, color and even spacing. 

## Padding, Border, Radius
Control your box's padding, border and radius whether it's an overall adjustment or individual sides and corners.

## States
Message box gives you greater flexability by setting up general, info, success, warning, and error states.
