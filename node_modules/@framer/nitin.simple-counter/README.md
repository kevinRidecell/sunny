# Simple Counter

This component is similar to an [iOS Stepper Control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/steppers/), but also displays a numberâ€”the count.

Colors are customizeable, the component is responsive, and the decrement button deactivates when the count reaches zero.
