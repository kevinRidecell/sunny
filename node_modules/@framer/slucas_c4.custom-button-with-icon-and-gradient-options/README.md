## Overview

This custom button component was built out of a need to have a few more options, such as:

 - The ability to select your own custom icon from the file browser (to the left or the right of the text)
 - The option to have a linear gradient
 - Options for the shadow style, on hover and when pressed
 - Options for different button states, selectable from a dropdown



## How does it work?

Check out the example file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t6guam8uusfaqtc/Button%20+.framerx?dl=0) to see how the different button styles have been configured. 


I have grouped button options into 3 sections:

 - Typography
 - Style
 - Animation

In **Typography**, you can edit button text, font, size, weight, text transform and letter spacing.

In **Style** you can configure whether the button has an icon (left or right of the text - you select an SVG or PNG using the file picker), gradient, border style and thickness, shadow (including different shadow styles for default, on hover and pressed), and button radius.

In **Animation** you can select the hover and tap scale, as well as the scale and colour animation (taken from the default Framer button).



## Notes

 - You can now select different states from a dropdown
 
 - The disabled toggle should now select the disabled style when toggling.

Thanks to the Framer team for inspiration (some of the code used here was based on the default Framer button component).
